1. Try initial guess of min_len/2 search_len
2. Check if there is a shared substring of length search_len between input[0] and input[1]
    3. If there is, check if 
    3. If there is, check if that same string is present in input[2]
        4. If it is, 
    4. If not, set min_len = search_len and search_len = (min_len + max_len) / 2
